### Find two other relative links and add those to the Readme.md as well.
> Array

> My basic interpretation: Arrays are orders lists,
starting the count at 0, 
indexing multiple variable types in sequence relative to one another. 
### Source: https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Array.html

> "An array is just a list of items in order (like mangoes, apples, and oranges). 
Every slot in the list acts like a variable."
### Source2: http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_arrays.html

> "Ruby arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object."
### Source3: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_arrays.htm

> Hash

> My basic interpretation: The Hash class is a type of array, 
structured much like words and definitions in a dictionary.
Creating an associative value paired with a keyword.
### Source: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html

> "A hash is a value of key-value pairs."
### Source2: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_hashes.htm

> "Hashes, sometimes known as associative arrays, are similar in the way that they are indexed collection of objects."
### Source3: http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_hashes.html

> Chronic (Rubygem)

> My basic interpretation: Chronic is a ruby written parser(language converter)
that involves date and time.
### Source: https://rubygems.org/gems/chronic/versions/0.10.2

> "Chronic is a natural language date/time parser written in pure ruby."
### Source2: http://chronic.rubyforge.org/

> "Simple natural Ruby language parser."
